# A-New-Body-To-Regulate-OTT-Content-In-India
The online content in India, especially on the premier platforms, has been under a lot of scrutinies from time to time. Some of the series has led to complaints being filed against them. Yes, the Government of Indian and its Information and Broadcast Ministry has said that it won’t interfere in the content provided in the digital medium. They have provided a list of essential things to be followed while the rest is left to the discretion of the creators.   The ‘discretion’ part comes under the self-regulatory policy of The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). It has a content code that is currently under implementation by all the agreed parties. Today (February 5th), The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) is going to conduct its annual event, The India Digital Summit. A new set of self-regulatory guidelines will be released here for the OTT platforms. A Digital Content Complaint Council (DCCC) will come into existence through the new guidelines. Every platform which complies to the DCCC will have to come up with a DCCC Forum. It will tell how to file the grievances to the customer and also give guidelines to resolve them promptly. We have to see how many existing OTT giants will sign up for DCCC.
